1. It took roughly 25 hours to complete this assessment. I realized quite a bit in that I was doing something incorrectly,   
   so that combined with debugging and the actual logic took a while.

2. I used a lot of Stack Overflow, YouTube tutorials, and W3Schools.

3. I didn't ask anyone any questions this QAP.

4. I did not ask any instructors any questions for this QAP.

5. This was easily the hardest QAP so far, though it is mostly my fault it was so difficult.
